start
*draw x cards*
what is the count?
answer
loop



TODO
- make count a running total (re-ask and perserve the count, decrement by 1 for now every guess)
- adjust by a random number
- make deck and draw a card every turn (make alexa say the card value or name (ie, jack), not the suit)
- shuffle the deck when low on cards
- randomize how many cards are drawn every turn
- add help prompt that explains card counting using the RSKO method
- add minus intent and utterances
- add rest of negative utterances
- script to pack src into a zip file
- make echo say negative instead of minus (do negative check, then flip positive and add 'negative')
